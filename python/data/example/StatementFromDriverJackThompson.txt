Statement from Driver - Jack Thompson:
I, Jack Thompson, was the driver of the XYZ Corporation's truck involved in the accident on June 5, 2023. As I was turning left onto Elm Street, I noticed Mr. John Smith attempting to cross the street. I applied the brakes immediately, but I was unable to stop in time, and the front of my truck collided with Mr. Smith. I am deeply sorry for the incident, but I want to clarify that it happened very quickly, and I did not have enough time to avoid the collision.
