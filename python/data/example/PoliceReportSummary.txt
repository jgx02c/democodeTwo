Police Report Summary:
Officer Name: Officer SmithDate of Report: June 5, 2023
Incident Details:
On June 5, 2023, at approximately 2:00 PM, I, Officer Smith, responded to a call regarding a pedestrian-vehicle collision at the intersection of Elm Street and Oak Avenue. Upon arrival at the scene, I observed a male pedestrian, later identified as Mr. John Smith, lying on the ground, conscious but in visible pain. Nearby was a delivery truck registered to the XYZ Corporation, with the driver, Mr. Jack Thompson, standing by.
Driver Statement:
According to Mr. Thompson, the driver of the XYZ Corporation's truck, he was turning left onto Elm Street when he noticed Mr. Smith attempting to cross the street. Mr. Thompson claimed that he applied the brakes immediately but was unable to stop in time, resulting in a collision between the front of his truck and Mr. Smith.
Witness Statements:
Several witnesses at the scene, including Ms. Rachel Green and Mr. Joe Brown, provided statements supporting Mr. Smith's account of the incident. They stated that Mr. Smith appeared to be cautious and looked both ways before entering the crosswalk, contradicting Mr. Thompson's claim that Mr. Smith's actions contributed to the collision.
Conclusion:
Based on the evidence gathered at the scene and witness statements, it is my opinion that Mr. John Smith was not at fault for the accident. The primary contributing factor to the collision was the failure of Mr. Jack Thompson, the driver of the XYZ Corporation's truck, to yield to Mr. Smith while he was lawfully crossing the street in the designated crosswalk.
