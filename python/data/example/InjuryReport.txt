Injury Report - Defendant:
Date: June 5, 2023Location: Intersection of Elm Street and Oak Avenue, Anytown, USA

Statement from Defendant (Two Days Later):
On June 5, 2023, I, Jack Smith, sustained injuries as a result of an accident involving Mr. John Smith and the XYZ Corporation's truck. I was crossing Elm Street when Mr. Smith suddenly entered the crosswalk without looking, causing me to swerve and injure myself as I attempted to avoid a collision. Immediately following the accident, I experienced pain in my lower back and left shoulder. I sought medical attention at the nearest hospital, where I was diagnosed with whiplash and a sprained shoulder. I was advised to undergo further medical evaluation and treatment to address my injuries.
David Johnson (Attorney) - Questioning Defendant:
David Johnson: Ms. Smiths, can you confirm the details of the accident that occurred on June 5, 2023?
Defendant: Yes, I can. I was crossing the street when Mr. Smith suddenly stepped into the crosswalk without warning, causing me to swerve and injure myself.
David Johnson: And did you seek medical attention immediately after the accident?
Defendant: Yes, I did. I went to the hospital right away to get checked out.
David Johnson: Can you describe the injuries you sustained as a result of the accident?
Defendant: I suffered from whiplash and a sprained shoulder. The pain was quite severe, and I knew I needed medical attention.

Rachel Green (Witness) - Contradictory Questioning:
Rachel Green: Mr.Smith you mentioned seeking medical attention immediately after the accident. Is that correct?
Defendant: Yes, that's correct. I went to the hospital right away.
Rachel Green: Interesting. Because according to this document, your statement was recorded two days after the incident. How do you explain the discrepancy?
Defendant: Oh, um... Well, I meant I sought medical attention as soon as I could after the accident.
Rachel Green: But wouldn't you agree that seeking medical attention two days later isn't exactly immediate?
Defendant: I... I guess so. But I was in pain, and I wanted to make sure I was okay.
Rachel Green: Thank you, Mr.Smith. That will be all.
