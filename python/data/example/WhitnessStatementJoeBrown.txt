Statement from Witness - Joe Brown:
On June 5, 2023, I witnessed the accident involving Mr. John Smith and the XYZ Corporation's truck. I was standing on the sidewalk near the intersection when I saw Mr. Smith waiting to cross the street. He appeared to be cautious, looking both ways before entering the crosswalk. As he began to cross, the XYZ Corporation's truck turned left onto Elm Street and struck him. Mr. Smith was thrown to the ground, and the truck came to a sudden stop. It was clear to me that Mr. Smith was not at fault for the accident.
